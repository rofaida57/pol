    Relations between Algeria and ,France have recently witnessed increasing
     tension. On January10, 2025,
      French Foreign Minister Jean-NoÃ«l Barrot stated that France"would have no
     choice but to respond" if Algeria continues its "escalatory stance." This came after Algeria refused to receive an
     influential Algerian figure deported from France. </div>

This tension arises amid a series of events, including the arrest of Algerian influencers in France on charges of spreading hate messages and a diplomatic confrontation over the detention of Algerian-French writer Boualem Sansal in Algeria. (alhurra.com)

Additionally, former French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal called for suspending the 1968 French-Algerian agreement, which grants Algerians special privileges regarding work and residency. (alhurra.com)

In an attempt to ease the situation, France, through its Foreign Ministry spokesperson Christophe Lemoine, expressed a desire to explore opportunities for dialogue with Algeria. (awras.com)</div>
